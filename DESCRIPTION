Description: This tool makes predictions of sublethal effects based on
    different exposure profiles and user-provided input parameters. It is
    based on the simplified DEB-TKTD model described by Jager (2020). The
    predicted output is the multiplication factor that would need to be
    applied to a given exposure profile to reduce growth or reproduction
    by X% (termed EPx by EFSA). The results are then directly compiled in
    a basic report document.
